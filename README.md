# ScreenerLibrary.org

A free, open repository of validated evaluation screeners for health, social services, and community organizations. Our goal is to make evidence-based screening tools easy to find, read, understand, and use.

## About

ScreenerLibrary provides digital interfaces for validated screening instruments, helping practitioners better understand how these tools operate and what they're really asking respondents. Currently focused on USDA food security screeners, with plans to expand across multiple domains including housing and utilities. 

## Current Available Screeners

- **2-Item Hunger Vital Signs** - Quick food insecurity risk assessment
- **6-Item USDA Food Security** - Short tool with severity classification  
- **18-Item USDA Food Security** - Comprehensive household and child food security measure

## Design Principles

**Simple** - Clean, accessible interfaces that focus on the screening experience without unnecessary complexity.

**Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies and fast loading times. No tracking, no data collection, no ads.

**Sustainable** - Built to last with standard web technologies and hosted on GitHub Pages for reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) via CDN
- **Interactivity**: [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) for form logic
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

No build process.
