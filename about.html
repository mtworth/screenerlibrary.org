        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
            <p>Food security screening tools help identify individuals and households that may be experiencing difficulty accessing adequate food due to limited resources. These validated screeners are used by healthcare providers, social workers, and community organizations to connect people with appropriate resources.</p>
            <p>After completing a screener, you'll receive information about your food security status and recommendations for resources that may be helpful.</p>
            <p>This website provides validated, easy-to-use screening tools to help assess food security status for both adults and children. Our goal is to provide a simple, accessible, and private way for individuals to understand their food security situation and find the help they need.</p>
