            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>ScreenerLibrary</strong> is a free, open repository of validated evaluation screeners used by practitioners in health, social services, and community organizations. Our goal is to make short, evidence-based screening tools easy to find, read, and use so organizations can quickly identify needs and connect people to services.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What do you mean by “validated”?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              In social science and public health, <em>validated</em> means a tool has gone through formal testing to show it measures what it intends to measure. Validation typically includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-600">
              <li><strong>Content validity:</strong> experts agree the questions cover the intended concept.</li>
              <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> the tool produces consistent results over time or across raters.</li>
              <li><strong>Construct/criterion validity:</strong> the tool correlates with related outcomes or gold-standard measures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
              Validated does not mean a screener is a clinical diagnosis. It is a brief instrument for identifying probable needs that merit follow-up.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Which screeners are available?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              We started by digitizing the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food insecurity screeners (e.g., the 6-item and 18-item modules). For a full and up-to-date list of available screeners, see <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 underline">Available Screeners</a>.

          <section>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Will you add more screeners?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              Yes — we plan to add more validated screeners across domains (housing, mental health, substance use, caregiver stress, etc.). If there's a specific tool you want digitized, please <a href="https://forms.gle/your-google-form" class="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a request via this Google Form</a>.

          <section>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Will the screeners be available in other languages?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              Currently we are prioritizing English-language screeners. We can add translations where validated translations exist or where community demand justifies effort. If you would like us to prioritize a language, <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 underline">contact us</a> or indicate it on the request form.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How should I use these screeners?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              The specific use of screeners for program management is dependent on the use case and context. Generally, practicioners use screeners to evaluate and benchmark the status of clients, patients, or other individuals against known categories. For specific guidance, we recommend working with evaluation staff at your organization or consult your local university.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Do you store submitted screener responses?</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              No. We do not record or store any responses submitted through the public, browser-based screeners. The site provides the screening instrument and local guidance only. If you need a hosted or data-collecting implementation, please <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 underline">get in touch</a> to discuss options and privacy safeguards.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              ScreenerLibrary.org was built by me, Maxwell. I work in the social sector and wanted a transparent, easy way to explore the logic and wording of common screeners.
